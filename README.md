# brick-breaker
This is a simple brick breaker game that I developed while following a YouTube tutorial. The game is created using vanilla JavaScript (no framework) as well as some HTML and CSS. 

The main purpose of developing this game is to gain some experience and get a feel for JavaScript game development, and to use this knowledge to create my own tetris game using JS.

I used [CodeSandbox](codesandbox.io) as my development environment, and followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0).
