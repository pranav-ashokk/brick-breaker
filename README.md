# brick-breaker
This is a simple brick breaker game that I developed while following a YouTube tutorial. The game is created using vanilla JavaScript (no framework) and HTML5. 

The main purpose of developing this game is to gain some experience and get a feel for JavaScript game development, and to use this knowledge to create my own tetris game using JS.
